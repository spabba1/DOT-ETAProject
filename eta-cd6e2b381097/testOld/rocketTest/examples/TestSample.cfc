	Test suite for Sample Application
	
	Note that although we are testing a CFC in this instance, we could also test includes,
	custom tags, functions or even web pages or remote services using cfhttp etc.

	<!---
		This test case fails because of a bug (for demo purposes) in
		the addOne() method. The test output reports this as a "Failure"
		and breaks down the assert expression so that you understand why it failed.
		This breaking-down is why RocketUnit can get away with a single assert statement,
		unlike the various *Units that need assertEquals(), assertNotEquals() etc
		to make a sensible message when an assertion fails.
		
		Note that a bug in your test method will also be reported as an error.

		The squareRoot function has a syntax error in it.  In the results this
		will be reported as an "Error" rather that a "Failure".  Note that

		You should test for abnormal processing too.  Here is an example of testing 
		for an exception that should be thrown by our method.  We're not suggesting you should
		test all the built in functions - that's Adobe's job. You might want to check that
		cfparams are in place, or that the cfthrow in your method is creating the right
		sort of exception.

		Here you could add some private helper methods to be used by your testing code.
